## Theme Park.

Model a theme park and it's customers.

1. Using a 'Ride' abstract class, create 2 or 3 rollercoaster type rides.
Parameters could include price, min age/height etc.
2. Using a customer class create instances of people to use the rides. Give them an age, height and money.
3. Allow the customers to interact with the rides (I.E. check they are tall/old enough) have them pay their money.
Extensions;
4. Expand the model in whichever direction you like. Add different types of ride, create a queuing system.
